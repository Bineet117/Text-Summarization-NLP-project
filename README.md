# 📝 Text Summarization Project  

## 🌟 Overview  
The **Text Summarization Project** simplifies and condenses large pieces of text into concise, meaningful summaries. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project supports both extractive and abstractive summarization methods, deployed through a user-friendly Flask web application.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Summarization Methods**:  
  - 🖍️ **Extractive Summarization**: Identifies and extracts key sentences from the text.  
  - ✨ **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates human-like summaries in natural language.  
- 🌐 **Interactive Flask Web App**: Upload text files or input text directly via an intuitive interface.  
- ⚙️ **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust summary length and style.  
- 📈 **Scalable**: Handles texts of various lengths and complexities.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Backend Framework**: Flask  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries and Tools**:  
  - 🤗 `transformers` (Hugging Face) for pre-trained summarization models like T5 or BART.  
  - 🧠 `spaCy` or `NLTK` for text preprocessing.  
  - 🖼️ `Flask-Bootstrap` for responsive web UI (optional).

## 🌟 Example  

**Input:**  
*"**Topic: Importance of Renewable Energy**  
Renewable energy is a critical solution to the growing global demand for clean, sustainable power. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal are abundant, eco-friendly, and have minimal environmental impact. Transitioning to renewable energy helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat climate change, and improve air quality. It also promotes energy independence, reduces reliance on finite resources, and creates jobs in emerging green industries. As technology advances and costs continue to fall, renewable energy has become increasingly accessible, offering a viable path toward a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet."*  

**Output (Summarized):**  
*"Renewable energy is a critical solution to the growing global demand for clean, sustainable power. Transitioning to renewable energy helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat climate change and improve air quality. It also promotes energy independence, reduces reliance on finite resources and creates jobs in emerging green industries."*
